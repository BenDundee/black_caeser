# First experiment: RGB LED
![Circuit 9](https://github.com/BenDundee/black_caeser/blob/master/labnotes/2018-12-02.png)
 - See "Circuit 9" in examples
 - Resistors are all 330 Ohm.
 - Learned a few things:
   - The "Digital" pins (labeled 0 through 13) all seem to support _both_ `digitalRead` and `analogRead`
     as well as the corresponding `Write` methods. I wonder why they're labeled as such on the board?
   - RGB LEDs have four legs. The longest leg (2, by convention) is the ground, leg 1 is red, leg three is green, 
     leg 4 is blue.
 - Need the next level of challenges here, these are trivial.

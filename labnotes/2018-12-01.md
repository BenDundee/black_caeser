# Setting up Arduino for First time
- Look at projects here: https://www.makerspaces.com/15-simple-arduino-uno-breadboard-projects/

## Other useful stuff:
- Managing multiple ssh keys for work/personal github:

# First experiment: LED w/ Dimmer
![Circuit 4](https://github.com/BenDundee/black_caeser/blob/master/labnotes/2018-12-01.png)

 - See "Circuit 4" in examples
 - Diagram. Not sure how to complete the circuit between the diginal and analog input.
   - Likely just a black box that says "Arduino"
 - First run -- didn't work? All wires were attached, turned out that LED bulb was bad!
 - Retried w/ red bulb, it works.
   - Note that the indicator light on the Arduino blinks at the same rate that the light in the circuit blinks
   - And, you can break the circuit by removing the bulb, and the light on the Arduino continues to blink
   - Kind of makes sense, look at the circuit
